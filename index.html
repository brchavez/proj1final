      <h2>More About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        For awhile, the question of future plans was a complete mystery to me until two years ago where I found a passion in tech and computer science. Since then, I've spent countless amounts of time dedicated to programming. Outside of school, I'm strongly fluent in c# and aiming to grow in c++.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h4>Bussing Tables at Cuba 312</h4>
      <p>
        Two summers ago, I got a job bussing tables at Cuba 312, a local cuban restaurant. Being a quiant place with a vast amount of foot traffic, I'd always be doing some of the servers jobs, resulting in my job being everything but the kitchen, getting orders, and using the IPad at the front. I worked 15 hours a week for approximately two months or so.
      </p>
      <h4>Camp Nebagamon Cook</h4>
      <p>One of my friends goes to this camp in northern Wisconsin and convinced me to go, and I worked there as a cook. This job was incredibly laborious. 48 hour work weeks, where each hour working involved intense work cooking, cleaning, or serving. It was an incredibly rough but rewarding job. As I said, I worked 48 hours a week, and for around 8 and a half weeks.</p>

    <h5>So, as of right now I'm unemployed so I can focus on college apps and the SAT. For now, that's everything I think. You should go back to the top at look at the other stuff.</h5>
